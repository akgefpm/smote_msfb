Pending Steps:-
0. Get the datasets
    - Completed: scale, bibtex, polarity
1. Incorporate Hubness metric into algorithm
2. Reporting of the dataset characterstics -  All data folders will have a file named processed_dataset.parquet which will be processed and aggregated metrics stored
    0) Domain of dataset
    a) No. of rows
    b) No. of columns
    c) Multi Response / Single Response
    d) Imbalance ratio
    e) Good hub and bad hub metrics    
3. Resampling is classification algorithm specific
4. Cross validation to determine the best level of resampling
5. Documentation of the repo and the code
6. Optimize the code
