-> Develop a function/package to do the resampling in the specified way --->  smote_msfb()    
    -> Incorporate Hubness metric into algorithm
    -> Level of resampling - cross validation
    -> BaseLearner as the classification algorithm <-- 

    -> Key functionalities of the package
        -> Give option to use LR as Base Learner OR user provided classification algor to identify the observations to be resampled. Condition 
        -> Give option to determine the level of resampling via cross validation OR specify a pre-determined level.

---------> The below exists and use the code as it is <--------------------
    
-> All other logic should be kept separate. 
    -> Reading the datasets and data massaging 
    -> Defining the cv spilts
    -> Run the resampling algorithm
    -> Run the classification algorithm
    -> Report the results
    -> Separate out the helper functions also
    
    -> Dump the parameters in a config file in output folder for later use [This is important for experimentation perspective.]
