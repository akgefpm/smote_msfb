Pending Steps:-
1. Incorporate Hubness metric into algorithm <- [THIS IS KEY ALGORITHMIC MODIFICATION]
2. Reporting of the dataset characterstics -  All data folders will have a file named processed_dataset.parquet which will be processed and aggregated metrics stored. Data summary code 
    0) Domain of dataset
    a) No. of rows
    b) No. of columns
    c) Multi Response / Single Response
    d) Imbalance ratio
    e) Good hub and bad hub metrics    
3. Resampling is classification algorithm specific <- [Need to make modification for this]
4. Cross validation to determine the best level of resampling
5. MI score for limiting the no. of feature <- MI information percentage captured
6. Documentation of the repo and the code
7. Optimize the code

Approach:
1. Select top features from the data which contribute to 95% of the MI. This removes a lot of redundant features from the data. 
2. Define neighbourhood based on reduced no. of features and weighted (normalized MI score) jaccard score
3. Identify the minority samples to be used for generating synthetic samples by using Logistic
