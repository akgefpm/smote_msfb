Pending Steps:-
1. Incorporate Hubness metric into algorithm <- [Incorporated]

2. Resampling is classification algorithm specific <- [Need to make modification for this. This is not without challenges. Probability predicted is dramatically different for different algorithms. For example, Trees can give much higher probability for the same minority sample (% of correct observations in the leaf node) hence the cut off will be diffcult to be defined. On the other hand, final metric is ROC AUC curve which is impacted across different probability cut offs.]  <- To be done later.

3. Cross validation to determine the best level of resampling <- To be done later. [This piece will come in handy to handles cases with severe immbalance]

4. Incorporate gmean and other accuracy metrics for classification 


6. Documentation of the repo and the code
7. Optimize the code

2. Reporting of the dataset characterstics -  All data folders will have a file named processed_dataset.parquet which will be processed and aggregated metrics stored. Data summary code 
    0) Domain of dataset
    a) No. of rows
    b) No. of columns
    c) Multi Response / Single Response
    d) Imbalance ratio
    e) Good hub and bad hub metrics
