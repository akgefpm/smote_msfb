      "this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched . and she's right , it is that bad . ) directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser's a geezer , \" and \" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in . steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .\n",

      "Review 2:\n",
      "some comedies are not funny no matter how hard they try , but baby geniuses , easily one of the worst films in years , doesn't even try that often . directed by bob clark ( porky's and porky's 2 ) , the film is a flat as the flat line on a heart monitor when the patient has died , something this comatose picture does in the very beginning . this would-be kathleen turner overacts with such abandon that her performance could only work in a parody , which this movie isn't . although the movie is shot in ugly , dark and sinister tones that would befit a horror movie about demonic babies , the movie does not intentionally try to scare us . the actors , who drone with all the emotive power of someone reading the phonebook , do get to participate in a few comic sketches , with repetitive injuries of the gonads being the most common . the moronic script by the writing committee of steven paul , francisca matos , robert grasmere , bob clark and greg michael is an insult to human intelligence . the on-going joke in the movie is that the viewers get to understand baby talk . these toddlers are among the most unfunny in the history of cinema . \" you idiots ! you imbeciles ! you morons ! \" you may feel like yelling those exact words at the screen . it is rated pg for some profanity , sexual innuendo and comic fist fighting violence and would be acceptable for most ages . my son jeffrey , almost 10 , liked the characters and gave the movie * * * . his friend jessica , almost 10 , thought the movie was really cute and gave it * * * .\n",
